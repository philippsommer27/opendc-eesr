EESR is directly integrated into OpenDC allowing you to automatically produce reports at the end of experiments.&#x20;

OpenDC interacts with EESR through the [Chaqoupy ](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/index.html)library which allows you to [use a python package](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/android.html#android-requirements) with java/kotlin.
