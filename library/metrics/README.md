# Metrics

A [metric ](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/kpi-metric-measure)is a quantifiable measure of only one _thing_ or a combination of other metrics. EESR concerns itself with metrics that measure efficiency in some form or another. These metrics can generally be divided into two categories: **efficiency**  and **sustainability**.&#x20;

#### :zap:Efficiency Metrics

Efficiency metrics refers to those that are only concerned with how much energy is wasted and not used productively. For instance, a Power Delivery Unit (PDU) that has an energy efficiency rating of 98% loses 2% of the input energy vs its output energy.&#x20;

****:herb:**Sustainability Metrics**

Sustainability metrics on the other hand provide insight into the environmtal sustainability of the data center. Such metrics usually consider carbon dioxide emission or cleanliness of energy sources in its definition.   &#x20;

**Mega Metrics**

One of the key [principles ](../../design/principles.md)of EESR is that there is no _one metric to rule them all_. However we believe that there are some metrics that are worth mentioning and supporting as there underlying measures are valuable and when used correctly can provide a generic overview of efficiency. We refer to such metrics as mega metrics.&#x20;

## Recording Guidelines

#### Assessment Period

Geography can play a tremendous role on the energy use and efficiency of a data center. To prevent misleading results, most metrics are most valid when measured throughout a full year as to account for seasonal variations of climate, energy production, and load variation.
