# What is EESR?

The Energy Sustainability and Efficiency Reporting (EESR) instrument aims to provide a complete report generation solution for data center energy efficiency. Featuring a curated library of reporting metrics and visualizations, EESR prioritizes ease of use while maintaining high configurability for all audiences.

The name of the instrument is not final. EESR was originally designed as a component of OpenDC and as such was named 'OpenDC Energy Sustainability and Efficiency Reporting'. However as a standalone product, EESR is too generic and does not properly communicate its scope.&#x20;
