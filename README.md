# What is EESR?

The Energy Sustainability and Efficiency Reporting (EESR) instrument aims to provide a complete report generation solution for data center (DC) energy efficiency. Featuring a curated library of reporting metrics and visualizations, EESR prioritizes ease of use while maintaining high configurability for all audiences.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The name of the instrument is not final. EESR was originally designed as a component of OpenDC and as such was named 'OpenDC Energy Sustainability and Efficiency Reporting'. However as a standalone product, EESR is too generic and does not properly communicate its scope.&#x20;

Why the need for EESR?



### Growing Knowledge Base

The real value of this instrument is beyond its fairly simply single page HTML builder. Rather, its in the wide and deep research of the DC energy efficiency reporting landscape in order to determine **how** to best report this subject. The culmination and findings of this research is described in the [metrics ](library/metrics/)and [graphs ](library/graphs/)library as well as a research paper. This work not only attempts to consolidate the most important knowledge on the topic in one place, but also encourage the community to further research in DC energy efficiency by highlighting its importance.&#x20;

EESR hopes to expand with the community and stay up to date with the latest findings. As such we encourage pull requests and issue submissions for this documentation and the [source code](https://github.com/philippsommer27/opendc-eesr).
